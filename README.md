Key concents I have learned from building this project

- [x] reset.css

```
ex) H1, Chrome 21px, Firefox 32px
reset kills all the default styles
```

- [x] Difference between space-between and space-around
- [x] Remove Visited property

```
// Visited link
a:visited {
color: black;
}

// get color from father
a {
color: inherit;
}

```
