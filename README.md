Key concents I have learned from building this project

- [x] reset.css
- [x] Difference between space-between and space-around
- [x] Remove Visited property
- [x] Position fixed needs width
- [x] Box sizing: border-box
- [x] Difference between margin and padding
- [x] to align items center => left: 0; right: 0; margin: 0 auto;
- [x] Gradient is background-image
- [x] "~"=> check younger siblings because CSS reads top to bottom ex) firstDiv:focus ~ .nextDivs
```
position fixed needs width and height. it needs width! because it's another layer

```

```
*{box-size: border-box}
Yo, don't make my box-size grow!
Be happy with what you have! even when I add padding!!
Play with what you currently have!
=> The box-size will be fixed.
```
